# Tutor.ia
An AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance the learning process through generative AI.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the document processing pipeline used in the Tutor.IA project. The main.py file serves as the entry point, orchestrating the parsing, splitting, and storage of documents to enable efficient document intelligence. It integrates various features and services, including document analysis, text splitting, and Azure Storage, to ensure a seamless workflow for processing documents. The implementation is designed to handle the end-to-end processing of documents, from configuration to file retrieval, making it a crucial component of the overall document management system.

## Getting started 

### Set the environment variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs that are accessible to any program running within the environment in which they are set. These variables often contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or configuration settings. To set them up, just copy the `.env.template` file and make a new file called `.env`. Then, fill in the blanks with the appropiate info, each variable is explained in the below table:

| **Parameter**                               | **Description**                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DOCINTELLIGENCE_API_ENDPOINT                | Endpoint URL for the Azure Document Intelligence service instance.                                          |
| DOCINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY                     | API key used to authenticate requests to the Azure Document Intelligence service.                           |
| STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME                        | Name of the Azure Storage account.                                                                          |
| STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONTAINER                   | Name of the Azure Storage container where the data resides.                                                 |
| STORAGE_ACCOUNT_CONNECTION_STRING           | Connection string for accessing the Azure Storage account.                                                  |


### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xoubinha/tutor.ia.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
